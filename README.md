# EpistemicCommunities

These are scripts for the paper I have on epistemic communities. 

The main script that initialises the agent-based model is the fixed-abm-model file. The parameters and core visualisations are set largely through the main-analysis-streamlined file. 

All other files are simple scripts that analyse the data to create other visualisations used.
